# Cogs

This is Team 21's work helpdesk solution for the fictious company 'Make-It-All'.

## Styling

All the styling is written in [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com), with some of the underlying styling lifted from [Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx).

## JS

We currently only use [jQuery](https://jquery.com), this might change in future.
