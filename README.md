# Cogs

This is Team 21's work helpdesk solution for the fictious company 'Make-It-All'.

## Styling

All the styling is written in [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com), with some of the underlying styling lifted from [Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx).

## JS

The libraries we use are:
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for selectors and animations
* [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) for mobile event
* [Timezone Picker](https://github.com/dosx/timezone-picker) for the timezone map on the settings page
